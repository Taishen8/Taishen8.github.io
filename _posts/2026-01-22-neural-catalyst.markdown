## Overview
Neural Catalyst is a deep learning framework designed to predict the outcome of complex chemical reactions. By representing molecules as graphs and using attention mechanisms, we can capture the intricate dependencies between atoms.

## Approach
We utilize a SE(3)-equivariant Transformer model to ensure that our predictions are invariant to rotations and translations of the molecule in 3D space.

## Key Findings
- 20% improvement in reaction yield prediction over baseline models.
- Identification of novel catalytic pathways for sustainable energy production.
