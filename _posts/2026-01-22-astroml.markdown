## Introduction
With the advent of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, we are entering an era of big data in astronomy. AstroML uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify billions of galaxies automatically.

## Dataset
We used the Galaxy Zoo dataset for training, which includes millions of crowd-sourced classifications.

## Performance
Our model reaches human-level accuracy (98%) across 5 major morphological categories.
