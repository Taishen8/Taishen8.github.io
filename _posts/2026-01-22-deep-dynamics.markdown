## Abstract
Traditional fluid dynamics simulations are computationally expensive. In this project, we leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn the underlying physical laws and predict fluid behavior in real-time.

## Methodology
We use a mesh-free approach combined with a Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) architecture. The model is trained on data generated from high-fidelity CFD solvers.

## Results
Our model achieves a 100x speedup compared to traditional solvers while maintaining 95% accuracy in pressure and velocity fields.

## Conclusion
Deep Dynamics paves the way for real-time interactive physics simulations in engineering and design.
